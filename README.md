# PDF-Operator-withGUI
A PDF operator in which, logic using Python and GUI using Tkinter. 

Currently it has two features:

1. PDF Merger: This feature allows you to select multiple PDF files from your device and merge them into one PDF document.

2. Image to PDF Converter: This feature allows you to easily convert (.jpg, .jpeg, .png)image formats into PDF documents. You can select multiple image files to convert & merge them into one PDF document.
   
But later I'm going to add some more features like extracting specific page from PDF, etc.
